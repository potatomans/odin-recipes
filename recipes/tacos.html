        <p>These crispy fried beef tacos—sometimes called "Arizona Tacos"— are having a moment on TikTok. You press the raw meat onto the tortilla before frying the whole thing for the ultimate crunchy exterior with a tender, juicy filling. And they're easy to make—here's how.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>8(5-inch) corn tortillas</li>
            <li>1 pound ground sirloin</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons taco seasoning</li>
            <li>3/4 teaspoon kosher salt, divided</li>
            <li>1/2 cup vegetable oil, or as needed for frying</li>
            <li>1/2 cup minced white onion</li>
            <li>1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro</li>
            <li>lime wedges, for serving</li>
            <li>1/4 cup salsa, or as needed, for serving</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
            <li>Lay 8 tortillas flat on a surface.</li>
            <li>Combine beef, taco seasoning, and 1/2 teaspoon salt in  a medium bowl.</li>
            <li>Press 1/4 cup of beef mixture onto half of each tortilla.</li>
            <li>Heat 1/4-inch of oil in a high-sided skillet over medium heat until shimmering. Working in batches, carefully add one taco at a time, flat, to the hot oil.</li>
            <li>Hold empty side of the tortilla with a pair of tongs, and fold over beef filling once the shell is softened, about 5 seconds.</li>
            <li>Cook, turning once, until shell is golden brown and beef is no longer pink in the center, 30 seconds to 1 minute per side.. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C). </li>
            <li>Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate, and sprinkle with remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt.</li>
            <li>Serve immediately topped with onion and cilantro. Serve with lime wedges, salsa, and hot sauce.</li>
        </ol>
